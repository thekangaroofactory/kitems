The framework is based on two main concepts – *data model* and *items*.

## Data Model

The data model contains the specifications of the *items* to manage.

For each attribute, the data model carries information like its name and type, but also a method to determine its default value as well as logical values to indicate if it should be skipped in forms, displayed in the table view or used to sort the data.

Supported types are numeric, integer, logical, character, Date and POSIXct.

> Note: class POSIXlt is not supported as it stores datetime values into a list\
> POSIXct should be used to store datetime attributes.

## Items

*Items* are stored in a data frame that fits with the data model rules.\
That means the data model is implemented in all functions related to *item* management.
