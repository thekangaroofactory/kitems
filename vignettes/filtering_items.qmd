## Introduction

Kitems provides standard features to enable automatic data filtering.

## Reminder

The module server returns a composite value that includes references to reactive values:

-   items

-   filtered_items

-   filter_date

``` {#return_value .R}
# -- call module server
mydata <- kitems(id = "myid")

# -- access the data
mydata$items()
mydata$filtered_items()
mydata$filter_date()
```

## Widgets

### Item table

The *item* table widget is by default a filtered view of the *items*.\
It displays the content of `filtered_items()` .

It is delivered through the `filtered_view_widget` function.

The reason for not having a non filtered *item* table is that if the goal is to display the whole list of *items* without any filtering, then there would be no added value compared to using the renderDT / DTOutput functions directly in the main Shiny application.

As of now, only date filtering support has been implemented.

### Date slider

The date slider widget is automatically enabled when the data model contains an attribute that is named '*date*' (strictly) and accessible through the `date_slider_widget` function.

![](images/screenshot_date_slider_widget.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the widget"}

Its behavior is driven by two strategies:

-   '*this-year*' – automatically selects and extends the range of date belonging to current year upon *item* operations (this is the default).

-   '*keep-range*' – keeps the selected range no matter if *items* are added or removed [^1]

[^1]: One exception is if the item that is deleted has its date being equal to the minimum or maximum of the entire range. The reason is that the min and max of the dateSliderInput will be updated when the items data frame is modified, hence it is not possible to have the selected range going beyond its limit.

When the server is initialized, it will scan the *items* to setup the *dateSliderInput* range to the minimum and maximum of the date column, and the selected range to the values fitting with current year. [^2]

[^2]: current year standing for the output of `format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")`

## Reactive lifecycle

Whenever the date range value is modified in the widget, it will trigger two actions in the reactive lifecycle of the module server:

-   `filter_date` will be updated with the value of the slider input [^3]

-   `filtered_items` will be updated with the *items* fitting with the selected date range [^4]

[^3]: those values could also be directly accessed through the main application input argument as `input$id-date_slider` with *id* being the module server namespace

[^4]: if sorting feature is enabled in the data model, it will also be sorted

## Considerations

### Initialization

The most important notion to understand when it comes to the initialization of the `filtered_items` (and its view) is that when the module server is launched, there is no way to determine if the main application will implement the date slider widget.

The module server checks the data model for a '*date*' attribute and creates an output that will be accessible through the `date_slider_widget` function. But it can't guess if it's actually going to be implemented of not.

For this reason, the `filtered_items` reactive value is initialized with the same value as `items`.

This means, if the content of `filtered_items` is reused within the main application - for example to build a plot - it is strongly advised to check if `filter_date` is `NULL` or not to avoid computing the plot twice.

It can be done by implementing one of the following options in the *renderPlot* expression:

-   check if the filter input is "truthy" with `req(mydata$filter_date())`

-   use `bindEvent` function on the `filtered_items` with `ignoreInit = FALSE`
